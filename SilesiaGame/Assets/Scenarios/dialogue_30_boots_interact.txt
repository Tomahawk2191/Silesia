By the time I joined the Allies, there was no more new equipment for me.
Funnily enough, I ended the war fighting Germany in German boots.
I've had to hide these things for years.
If the Soviets knew that I had ever been in the Wehrmacht, I would've been killed.
But, strangely, I can't bring myself to throw the box away.
I don't ever want to forget what they did to my people.
