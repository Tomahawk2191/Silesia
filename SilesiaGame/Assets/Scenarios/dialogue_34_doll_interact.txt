Ah, Katia's doll, one of my most treasured belongings.
When I was in the Wehrmacht, our army occupied a town in Ukraine for a month.
I spent my time staying in the home of a family.
Their daughter, Katia, sewed me this doll as an act of kindness.
It reminds me of the one I had from my childhood.
They were both made to distract from a time of violence.
