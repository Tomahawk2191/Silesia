The day the doctors told me about my Black Lung, I felt a deep terror in my stomach.
This medicine helps keep me comfortable, but I know there’s no cure.
The sickness is to be expected, having been in the mines for as long as I have.
In fact, many of my friends got the disease years ago.
This is the price we paid for our living.
