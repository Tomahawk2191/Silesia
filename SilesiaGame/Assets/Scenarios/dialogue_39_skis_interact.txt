These are my treasured skis - I bought them when I was much younger.
They were very valuable at the time.
I had to work extra on weekends and holidays to earn them.
This was even though my regular shifts were already 12 hours a day.
Now that I think about it, though, I barely ever got to use them.
I always dreamed of going to the Alps...
