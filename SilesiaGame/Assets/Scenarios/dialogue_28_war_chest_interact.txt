I was in my late 20s when I got my marching orders from the Wehrmacht, and I didn’t have much of a choice.
It was either fight for the Nazis, who barely tolerated us Polish Silesians, or die.
I spent a winter on the Eastern Front.
Anyone who was there understands why we called it Hell on earth.
Eventually, a battalion of us Silesians managed to coordinate a desertion effort.
After months of travel, we were able to take our rightful place in the Polish Army, fighting for the Allies.
My only regret is that it took so long.
