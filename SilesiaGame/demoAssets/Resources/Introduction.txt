<i>Grandpa!</i>
Hi, little one. When did you come back? I didn't hear you. 
<i>Just now! Grandma bought me some sweets. What do you have in your hands?</i>
Oh, that? It's my old hat. 
I guess I got a bit sentimental. It's my late friend's birthday. He would be 80 today, may St. Barbara watch over him.
I remember I had something of his here somewhere, my memory is not what it used to be...
Would you help me look?
