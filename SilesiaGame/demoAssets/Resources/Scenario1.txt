<i>Why are they here?</i>
Oh, these are my treasured skis, I bought them when I was 35 years old!
They were very valuable back then.
You could only get them for a special currency in a miners shop.
We had to work extra on weekends and holidays to earn it.
Even though we worked very hard during the weekdays already…
Still, we had to find even more time to work to keep the family afloat.
Even up to 12, 14 hours a day.
In the end, I didn’t even get to use them, now that I think about it…
