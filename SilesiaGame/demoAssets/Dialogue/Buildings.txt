<i>That building looks exactly like yours!</i>
Yes, because it is! All of the buildings in the neighborhood look very similar.
They were mass built to house us miners back in the day.
All my friends from the community used to live here.
They look the same on the outside, but the insidesâ€¦
They are all unique and different.
