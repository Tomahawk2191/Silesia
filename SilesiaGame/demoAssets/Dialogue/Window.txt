<i>Why are you cleaning the windows daily, grandpa?</i>
<i>Do you really like doing it?</i>
Well… You need to keep the windows clean.
They are the calling card of the family behind them.
Keeping them clean shows your work ethic.
Also, there is a lot of soot in the air.
If we didn’t clean them, you could not see the beautiful neighborhood outside.
