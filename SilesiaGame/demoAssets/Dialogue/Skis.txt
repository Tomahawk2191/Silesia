<i>Why are they here?</i>
Oh, these are my treasured skis, I bought them when I was 35 years old!
They were very valuable back then.
You could only get them for a special currency in a miner's shop.
We had to work extra on weekends and holidays to earn it.
Even though we already worked long hours during the weekdays - sometimes up to 12, 14 hours a day.
Now that I think about it, I didn’t even get to use them…
